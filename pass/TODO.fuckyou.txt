InstVisitor doesn't respond to Phi Functions, which prevents us from creating correct data flow across basic block merges.
If that were resolved, this branch could demonstrate a non-pointers version of Taint analysis if report was working.
Report can use the janky variable lookup functions to evaluate conditionals, but they need to be parsed first. BdwyAST.h #125
Once conditionals are evaluated, we just need a system to generate error output.

Then maybe we can find things that also apply in simple cases in the presence of pointers.
