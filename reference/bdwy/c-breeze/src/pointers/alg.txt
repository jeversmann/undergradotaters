1. At a location, if there is no min value, take min(dominator) + 1.

2. When we hit a location that dominates nothing:

   (a) Set max = min
   (b) Move up the dominator tree, setting max(dominator) = max + 1
   (c) When we hit a basic block that has a sibling,
         set min(sibling) = max + 1 and stop.
