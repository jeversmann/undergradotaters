README for C-Breeze 1.0

To build libc-breeze.a:

1.  Edit the file Makefile.inc to set up configuration by setting the
    following variables:

    CBZHOME:          environment variable to the directory generated by
                      cbz-1.0.tar.gz (aka: $ export CBZHOME=/path/to/c-breeze)

    OPT, DEBUG, PROF: numerical values to set the optimization, debug, and
                      profiling level. Only one value should be set,
                      unless you also edit the value of CFLAGS (change "="
                      to "+=").
    Utilities:        set the version of g++, yacc, etc. you want to use.

2.  'make headers' in CBZHOME
3.  (optional) 'make depend' in CBZHOME
4.  'make' (or 'make update') in CBZHOME.
5.  Have some coffee ;)

To build cbz executable:

1.  Build libc-breeze.a as described above
2.  'make cbz' in CBZHOME

Disclaimers: 

C-Breeze has been successfully compiled on Debian Linux using G++ 3.3,
3.4, 4.0 and 4.1.  Bison versions 1.35 or 1.875a (or later) are required
to compile C-Breeze.  There is a know bug in Bison 1.875 which prevents
generated parser from compiling with G++.  GCC 2.95 is required to use
'cbz' to compile C code.

This code is still experimental.  In particular, code in src/contrib
and src/backend are likely to fail, and painfully, when used other than
their intended manner.  The backend does not properly handle the following
(although this list is by no means complete):  function pointers, floating
point, initialization of aggregates, assignment of structs, function
parameters and results of aggregate type, and register allocation (when
in doubt, use -noreg with cbz).

Please report any bugs or problems to cbreeze@cs.utexas.edu.
